Holger Reinhardt from Layer 7 Technologies talks about when to use and when to not use an SDK for an API. Does for most developers consuming a public API in reality mean to consume a SDK? What are the implications for API providers? Does the API program target just the API, the API and a SDK or a SDK only? Looking at the IoT space, the availability of a SDK covering a wide range of platforms appears to become a crucial market differentiator. New services like IFTTT and Temboo enable the use of APIs without any technical knowledge and make them accessible to new consumers and users segments. A wide range of different models for SDK support exists. This talk will look at the emerging patterns of providing a SDK in addition to an API.
