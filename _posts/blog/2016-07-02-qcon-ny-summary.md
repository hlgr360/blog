### Implementing Infrastructure as Code
* [Description](https://qconnewyork.com/ny2016/presentation/implementing-infrastructure-code) and [slides](https://qconnewyork.com/system/files/presentation-slides/implementing_iac_-_qcon_nyc_2016.pdf)
* Website at <http://infrastructure-as-code.com>
* Motivations:
	* speed: get something to market fast, iterate, continuously improve it
		* heavy process to reduce danger vs everything goes
		* goal: be able to make changes rapidly, frequently and responsibly
	* challenges
		* server sprawl: config drift, automation fear cycle
* Infrastructure-as-Code: 
	* Applying software engineering tools to managing the infrastructure
	* Unattended automation (enforces discipline, discourages ‘out-of-band’ changes
	* Changes need to be tested as well, before doing a **DevOoops**
		* See <http://serverspec.org>
	* The process for applying changes is auditable (the responsible part)
		* Changes are tracked by commit
		* Automation enforces that processes are executed
		* See <http://47ron.in/blog/2015/01/16/terraform-dot-io-all-hail-infrastructure-as-code.html>
* Think about duplication
	* Re-use by forking: divergence vs decoupling
	* Sharing elements avoid monoliths - optimize to simplify changes

### How to optimize your culture for learning
* [Description](https://qconnewyork.com/ny2016/presentation/optimize-your-culture-learning)
* About creating high learning environments in [Recurse](https://www.recurse.com)
* Company mantra 'You are doing your thing at your time, and we bring the place and the community'
* RC is partnering with companies: 
	* value for participants improve their software skills, 
	* value to companies: hiring access
* Motivation
	* Fear is an obstacle to learning
		* People don’t want to look stupid
		* Create a positive feel around ‘I do not know’
		* RC social rules to reduce fear
			* No feigning surprise (What, you don't know?)
			* No “well, actually” (do not correct details which are irrelevant for the conversation)
			* No backset driving (lobbying criticism over the wall without participating)
			* No subtle-isms (no racism, sexism, even in a subtle way: where do you really come from?)
* What works for us 
	* Being transparent about our beliefs re-enforces learning
	* Being vocal about our values
	* Treat people like adults
		* Don't need to check in on people every day
		* Choice to participate in activities, meetings, etc vs mandating participation
* Key message
	* Hire attitude over skill
	* You can learn any skill, but you can’t learn curiosity

### Learnings from a culture first startup
* [Description](https://qconnewyork.com/ny2016/presentation/learnings-culture-first-startup)
* About creating the right culture at [Buffer](http://buffer.com)
* How do we know how to build a good culture
* What is culture
	* In every team: the explicit and implicit behaviors which are valued by the team	
	* Evolves and changes with each hiring
	* Best teams carefully manage culture
* At buffer culture is as important as the product
	* The result are our [buffer values](https://open.buffer.com/buffer-values/)
	* Crafting culture is hard: you hire for culture, you should be firing for culture		
	* Build the core team which aligns on culture
		* Interviews/hiring around culture fit
		* Spend less time convincing people, more time finding people who are already convinced
	* In order to hire for cultural fit, the team has to be on the same page
	* Lessons learnt from experimenting with culture
		* Transparency breeds trust (for team and customers)
			* See <hhtps://buffer.com/transparency>
			* Buffer transparency salary calculator
				* See <https://buffer.com/salary?r=1&l=10&e=2&q=0>
			* Term sheet and valuation of round A are public
				* See <https://open.buffer.com/raising-3-5m-funding-valuation-term-sheet/>
			* It is even more important to be transparent when things don’t go well
			* Culture is truly tested and defined during hard times
		* Implementing culture for a globally distributed team
			* Can hire the best people in the world
			* Hard to brainstorm (teams need mini-retreats)
			* Harder to get on the same page
			* Hard to disengage from work when working through Timezones
		* Cultivate culture for remote work
			* Need to be self-motivated and genuinely passionate about your work
			* Need to be resourceful, can get through roadblocks
			* But hard time to hire juniors/interns
			* Written communication is our main medium
				- But can’t replace in-person interactions: We have retreats
		* Make mistakes, keep tight feedback loops, iterate fast
			* Growing a remote team without managers was a bad choice
			* Instead of hiding mistakes, we share them openly
			* There are no balanced people, only balanced teams
				* Culture fit -> culture contribution
				* Its the leaders job to hire for balance
				* Hiring for culture fit assumes that culture is perfect and static
				* See <http://diversity.buffer.com>
					* A/B testing to attract different demographics
					* Taking hiring risks consciously (instead of reducing it)
						* Everyone is hired for a 45 day work bootcamp (full-time contracting period)
		* Can’t copy other cultures
		* Culture as differentiator (from 300 to 4000 job applicants)

### Container mgmt at Netflix
* [Description](https://qconnewyork.com/ny2016/presentation/scheduling-fuller-house) and [Slides](https://qconnewyork.com/system/files/presentation-slides/schedulingfullerhouse_nflx.pdf)
* Running container on AWS results in loosing EC2 metadata and IAM control
* Lesson: making container act like VMs
	* Implemented EC2 Metadata Proxy to bridge EC2 metadata into container
	* Why?
		* Amazon service sdk’s work
		* Service discovery continues to work
* Lesson: Image Layering
	* Engineering tool team generates base images (blessed, secured) for app envs (i.e. node.js)
	* Application images are derived from base image

---

### Cryptocurrency key storage
* [Description](https://qconnewyork.com/ny2016/presentation/banking-future-cryptocurrency-key-storage)
* How cryptocurrency is stored at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com)
* Sharding of crypto keys using [shamir secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing)
* Using cold and hot storage (consensus access)
	* Cold storage
		* Most of the crypto currency is stored in cold storage (disconnected)
		* Generated on hardware never connected to the internet
		* Stored on usb
		* Private key is being split into shards and encrypted independently 
		* Restoring private key requires majority of shards (individual parts can go rogue)
		* Example: Ethereum Cold Storage for smart contracts
			* 4 of 7 can retrieve the contract
			* 6 of 7 can change the contract
	- Hot storage
		* Fully insured
		* Ssingle server requiring a quorum of senior engineers to unlock/unscramble
* Multisig Vault
	* <https://www.coinbase.com/multisig>
	* Cold Storage as-a-Service (User Key, Shared Key, Coinbase Key)
		* User needs paper and passphrase
		* m-of-n sharding of key is possible

### What they do not tell you about microservices
* [Description](https://qconnewyork.com/ny2016/presentation/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-micro-services) and [Slides](https://qconnewyork.com/system/files/presentation-slides/qcon-microservices_talk_v7_for_web_upload.pdf)
* See also
	* <http://www.slideshare.net/DanielRolnick/microservices-and-devops-at-yodle>
    * <http://www.yodletechblog.com/2016/04/25/yodle-hackathon-april-2016-edition/>
* Good pragmatic steps for evolving from monolith to microservice architecture
	* After split Postgres started to break down with connection pooling, used an external connection pooler like <https://pgbouncer.github.io>
    * Choose mesos/marathon
    * Thrift-based macro services
    * Smart pipes vs context-aware apps
        * Decoupling application from service discovery
        	* (v1) curator framework from Netflix brought into Zookeeper
        	* (v2) hibachi by dotCloud (dedicated routing hosts)
        	* (v3) haproxy
        	* Marathon has built-in routing concept using haproxy (generates haproxy config)
        	* Started using qubit bamboo
        	* Can iterate routing and discovery independently from application, but run into scale problem around 300 service (square on every service needs to know every other service and health)
			* Moving back to topology of (v2) but with HAProxy
	* Continious Integration/ Continious Deployment CI/CD
		* Using Sentinel to manage services
		* Concept of [canary release](https://www.infoq.com/news/2013/03/canary-release-improve-quality)
	* Container make things more simple but leave mess behind
		* Need to clean up container images: [garbage collection in registry?](http://www.yodletechblog.com/2016/01/06/docker-registry-cleaner/)
	* Monitoring
		* Graphite and Grafana
			* Did not scale, since every team had to build own dashboard
			* Too much manual effort and no alerting
		* Switched to New Relic
			* Fully monitored if agent is present
			* Goal was 100 apps in 100 days
	* Source code management
		* Using [Hound](https://github.com/houndci/hound) to help with code searching
		* Using [GitRepo](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/) to help keep repos up to date
	* Human service discovery
		* Using [Sentinel](http://www.yodletechblog.com/2015/12/14/yodles-continuous-improvement-of-continuous-delivery/) for developer finding services

	* Architecture is hard to change, so make architecture itself evolvable
* The spine model
	* Needs -> Values -> Principles -> Practices -> Tools
	* going up to the spine to break deadlock
* Cargo cutting
	* Understand the practices, principles, and values 
* But getting lazy with non-functional requirements
* Just Enough Software Architecture
	* Recommended book [Just enough software architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Just-Enough-Software-Architecture-Risk-Driven/dp/0984618104/)
	* Ebook format available through <http://georgefairbanks.com/e-book/>
* Embrace BDD-Security framework for BDD-style security testing
