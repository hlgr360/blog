An opinionated investigation into the impact of the Internet of Thing on APIs. What will remain and what will change? How will the future API design, protocols and developer experience be impacted by the promises and limitations of IoT. If you are wondering if IoT is hype or reality and how you will integrate it with it from an API perspective this talk is for you. This presentation will get you an (admittedly) opinionated overview over the current state of the art and possible future direction of APIs in IoT.
