The Internet of things (IoT) is due to become reality sooner rather than later. Instead of a handful of Internet-connected devices in the average home, we might see dozens. From thermostats to refrigerators to water meters to hot water heaters, these devices will soon be transmitting data to and receiving data from sources on the Internet.
